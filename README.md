## Summary
In this repository, we are going to show you how to chat with multiple PDFs using the LangChain app in Python. The LangChain app provides free LLMs (Language Model Models) and embeddings that we can use for natural language processing tasks.

#### Highlights
- The LangChain app is a language model platform that can be used for various NLP tasks.
- We can chat with multiple PDFs using the LangChain app by converting the PDFs to text and then inputting the text into the app.
- We can use the free LLMs and embeddings provided by the LangChain app to enhance our natural language processing tasks.

#### Technical Details
- The LangChain app provides free LLMs and embeddings.
- The LangChain app can be used to chat with multiple PDFs.
- To chat with multiple PDFs, we need to convert the PDFs to text.
- We can convert a PDF to text using libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfminer.six.
- After converting the PDFs to text, we can input the text into the LangChain app to chat with it.
- The LangChain app uses LLMs and embeddings to generate responses in a chat-like manner.
- LLMs stands for Language Model Models, which are pre-trained models that can generate text based on the input.
- Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
- The LangChain app provides free LLMs and embeddings that we can use for our NLP tasks.
- By using the LangChain app, we can enhance our NLP tasks without the need for extensive training or resources.
